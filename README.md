# Bulls & Cows

A tiny console impelmentation of [Bulls & Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) game, with a bit of self-help.

You see number of combinations remained, you can mark digits as oresumably absent or present with colorization, you can check your attempt before actually pushing it.

If you're good enough, I suppose you will be close to six attempts.

Now this is so good that if are an addict, you would lose interest in wasting time!
